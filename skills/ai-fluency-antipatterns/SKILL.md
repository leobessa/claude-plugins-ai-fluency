# Overview

**AI Fluency Anti-patterns** catalogs recurring mistakes that undermine effective AI use. These patterns appear across all skill levels and persist because they "feel" productive while actually degrading outcomes.

**Core Principle:** Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do.

**Usage:** Reference this when diagnosing AI effectiveness problems or training others.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- When AI outcomes consistently disappoint
- When diagnosing others' AI usage problems
- When creating AI training materials
- When building organizational AI standards
- During self-assessment of AI practices

## The 15 Anti-Patterns

### Cognitive Anti-Patterns

#### 1. Automation Complacency

**What it is:** Reduced vigilance because "AI is handling it."

**Symptoms:**
- Reviewing AI output less thoroughly over time
- Assuming AI quality is consistent
- Not noticing degraded output quality
- Trusting AI more than evidence warrants

**Root cause:** Cognitive offloading without maintaining oversight.

**Fix:** Scheduled verification regardless of past performance. Never assume consistency.

---

#### 2. Output Authority Bias

**What it is:** Treating AI output as more authoritative than warranted.

**Symptoms:**
- Accepting AI conclusions without verification
- Deferring to AI over domain expertise
- Using AI output to end debates rather than inform them
- "The AI said..." as a trump card

**Root cause:** Conflating fluency of expression with accuracy of content.

**Fix:** Treat all AI output as hypothesis. Verify against independent sources.

---

#### 3. Sunk Cost Prompting

**What it is:** Continuing to iterate on bad prompts because of effort invested.

**Symptoms:**
- 10+ iterations on the same prompt
- Tweaking words rather than reconsidering approach
- "I've spent an hour on this, it has to work"
- Refusing to start fresh

**Root cause:** Emotional attachment to effort, not outcomes.

**Fix:** Set iteration limits. After 3 failed attempts, reframe the problem entirely.

---

### Process Anti-Patterns

#### 4. Vague Intent Delegation

**What it is:** Asking AI to do things without specifying what you actually want.

**Symptoms:**
- "Analyze this data" (analyze how? for what?)
- "Make this better" (better in what way?)
- "Help me with this" (help how?)
- Multiple iterations to clarify what should have been specified

**Root cause:** Unclear thinking about objectives, masked by AI's willingness to respond.

**Fix:** Define success criteria before prompting. If you can't specify what you want, think more before delegating.

---

#### 5. Prompt Magic Thinking

**What it is:** Believing there's a secret prompt formula that unlocks perfect results.

**Symptoms:**
- Searching for "the perfect prompt"
- Copying prompts without understanding why they work
- Treating prompt engineering as mystical
- Believing specific words have special power

**Root cause:** Treating prompts as incantations rather than specifications.

**Fix:** Focus on clarity of requirements, not magic phrases. Understand what you're asking for.

---

#### 6. Iteration Without Learning

**What it is:** Repeating prompts hoping for different results without changing approach.

**Symptoms:**
- Same prompt, slightly different wording, many times
- No systematic experimentation
- No hypothesis about why it's not working
- Hope-based iteration

**Root cause:** Not treating AI interaction as a diagnostic process.

**Fix:** Each iteration should test a specific hypothesis. Document what you learn.

---

#### 7. Context Dumping

**What it is:** Providing massive context without curation, overwhelming the AI.

**Symptoms:**
- Pasting entire documents into prompts
- "Here's everything, figure it out"
- Expecting AI to determine relevance
- Long contexts with no structure

**Root cause:** Avoiding the work of identifying what matters.

**Fix:** Curate context. Provide what's relevant, structured clearly. Less is often more.

---

### Verification Anti-Patterns

#### 8. Verification Theater

**What it is:** Going through verification motions without actually verifying.

**Symptoms:**
- Skimming output and saying "looks good"
- Checking format but not content
- Verifying easy things, skipping hard things
- "I reviewed it" without specific checks

**Root cause:** Wanting credit for diligence without the effort.

**Fix:** Define specific verification steps. Document what was checked.

---

#### 9. First-Draft Acceptance

**What it is:** Using AI's first response without iteration or verification.

**Symptoms:**
- Copy-paste from AI to use immediately
- No review step
- Treating first draft as final
- "AI is good enough"

**Root cause:** Optimizing for speed over quality.

**Fix:** Budget time for review and iteration. First drafts are starting points.

---

#### 10. Overconfident Calibration

**What it is:** Being more confident in AI accuracy than evidence supports.

**Symptoms:**
- "AI is usually right, so this is probably right"
- Not verifying because past outputs were good
- Generalizing from limited experience
- Ignoring base rates of error

**Root cause:** Availability bias from successful interactions.

**Fix:** Track actual accuracy. Maintain skepticism regardless of history.

---

### Structural Anti-Patterns

#### 11. Single-Shot Complex Tasks

**What it is:** Trying to accomplish complex multi-step tasks in one prompt.

**Symptoms:**
- Enormous prompts trying to do everything
- Disappointing results on complex tasks
- AI losing track of requirements
- Inconsistent quality across parts

**Root cause:** Not decomposing problems appropriately.

**Fix:** Break complex tasks into steps. Chain simpler prompts.

---

#### 12. No Scaffold for Reasoning

**What it is:** Expecting AI to reason well without structure.

**Symptoms:**
- "Think carefully about this" (no framework)
- Receiving poorly structured analysis
- AI missing obvious considerations
- Reasoning that doesn't follow a clear path

**Root cause:** Assuming AI will structure its own reasoning optimally.

**Fix:** Provide explicit reasoning frameworks. Tell AI how to think, not just what to think about.

---

#### 13. Role-Free Prompting

**What it is:** Not establishing perspective or expertise for AI to adopt.

**Symptoms:**
- Generic responses lacking depth
- Wrong level of detail or expertise
- Tone mismatches
- AI not knowing what lens to apply

**Root cause:** Leaving AI to guess what perspective to take.

**Fix:** Establish clear roles with relevant expertise and perspective.

---

### Organizational Anti-Patterns

#### 14. Inconsistent Application

**What it is:** Applying AI fluency practices inconsistently.

**Symptoms:**
- Good practices in some contexts, not others
- Quality varies by task type or stress level
- Selective verification
- "I'll be careful when it matters"

**Root cause:** Not internalizing practices as habits.

**Fix:** Apply practices consistently. Quality should not vary by context.

---

#### 15. Learning Plateau

**What it is:** Stopping improvement at "good enough."

**Symptoms:**
- Using same prompts and approaches indefinitely
- Not experimenting with new techniques
- "This works fine" without measuring
- No improvement over time

**Root cause:** Satisficing rather than optimizing.

**Fix:** Schedule regular practice and experimentation. Track improvement metrics.

## Anti-Pattern Diagnostic

When AI isn't working well, check:

```markdown
ANTI-PATTERN DIAGNOSTIC

Cognitive:
□ Am I complacent about verification?
□ Am I treating AI as too authoritative?
□ Am I over-invested in this approach?

Process:
□ Did I clearly specify what I want?
□ Am I hoping for magic instead of engineering?
□ Am I iterating systematically?
□ Did I dump context without curation?

Verification:
□ Am I actually verifying or just skimming?
□ Did I accept first draft without review?
□ Am I overconfident about accuracy?

Structural:
□ Is this task too complex for one prompt?
□ Did I provide reasoning structure?
□ Did I establish an appropriate role?

Organizational:
□ Am I applying practices consistently?
□ Have I stopped improving?

Identified anti-patterns:
1. [Pattern]
2. [Pattern]

Remediation:
1. [Action]
2. [Action]
